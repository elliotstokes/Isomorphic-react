React Isomorphic Example
=========================

A Really simple example that shows a react component being rendered on the server and also on the client within the same application.

##Installation

    $ npm install
    $ npm run build
    $ node index.js

Once started you can browse to /client and /server. The server rendering is rendering the header on the server and the client one is performing all the rendering on the client. 

Note there is a 2 second delay on the Javascript send to make it easier to see the difference between the two.
